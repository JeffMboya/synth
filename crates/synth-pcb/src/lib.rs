//! Copper geometry, as a value.
//!
//! These types are the shape every surface agrees on: the exporter writes
//! them into a `.kicad_pcb`, the DRC engine checks them, and an external
//! router's output is read back into them.
//!
//! They deliberately live apart from any router implementation. The native
//! maze router in `synth-route` is one *producer* of this shape and the
//! external routers are another, so a consumer that only needs to describe
//! copper should not have to depend on the code that produces it. Keeping
//! the value separate from the producer is what lets the production export
//! path emit an un-routed board without pulling in a router it will not use.
//!
//! An empty [`Routing`] is therefore a normal, meaningful value — it is
//! what an un-routed export carries — not a placeholder for a router that
//! has not run yet.
