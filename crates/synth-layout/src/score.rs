/// **It has no consumer yet.** It was built to rank candidates in
/// `place_clusters`' fitting sweep, and inserting it there was measured
/// to change nothing across the 52-design corpus: the sweep's surviving
/// candidates are three byte-identical arrangements (on an ungrouped
/// board `region_w` is inert, since there is only one region to
/// shelf-pack), so there is nothing for a cost to choose between. It
/// is kept because it is the measuring stick the *next* step needs —
/// either widening the sweep so the ordering actually varies, or the
/// schematic-side repair loop the PCB side already has. See the
/// "KNOWN LIMIT" comment on the selection key in `lib.rs`.
///
/// Two terms, both read off a column-major left-to-right layout:
///
/// - [`PlacementCost::net_span_mm`] — half-perimeter length, i.e. how
///   far the wires will have to run. A net whose endpoints sit far
///   apart in both axes is a net that either gets a very long wire or
///   degrades into a label stub, and both are bad.
/// - [`PlacementCost::net_shear_mm`] — how far a net's endpoints
///   deviate from their own mean `y`. In a columnar layout a net has
///   to travel vertically whenever its endpoints disagree on `y`, and
///   vertical travel is what crosses other nets' vertical runs. This
///   is the term that predicts crossings from positions alone.
///
/// Power and ground rails are excluded. They render as power symbols
/// rather than wires (`classify_power_flags`), so their span costs the
/// reader nothing — the same reason `build_cluster_adjacency` weights
/// them at `WEAK_NET_WEIGHT` instead of `STRONG_NET_WEIGHT`. The
/// router mirrors this: `classify_net_labels` skips power nets before
/// it ever measures a span.
