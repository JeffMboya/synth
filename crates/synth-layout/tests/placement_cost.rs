//! `placement_cost` is the only schematic quality metric the placement
//! search can actually use: `score` needs a routed `Layout`, and the
//! placer runs long before a wire is drawn. These tests pin its
//! behaviour against real designs from `fixtures/layout/` rather than
//! hand-built IR, because the interesting behaviour is all in the
//! interaction with real pin electrical types and real net shapes.
