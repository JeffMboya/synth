//! Functional-cluster recognition: one pass over [`Board`] that decides
//! which parts belong to which sub-circuit, and through which net and
//! pins.
//!
//! This used to be implemented three times — once per schematic motif in
//! `synth-layout`, once as PCB module extraction in `synth-place`, and
//! once as a decoupling check in the schematic ERC — and the three drifted
//! apart: the PCB placer never saw I²C pull-ups or dividers, the
//! schematic never saw RF matching networks, and each re-derived its own
//! idea of which capacitor decouples which IC. A schematic cluster that
//! the PCB placer could not act on was a cluster that only existed on
//! paper.
//!
//! One pass fixes that. Every consumer now reads the same
//! [`FunctionalCluster`] list, so "these parts belong together" is a fact
//! the IR holds rather than something each consumer re-derives.
//!
//! What the pass decides is *membership and connectivity* — never
//! coordinates. Presentation (which side of an anchor a member is drawn
//! on, where it lands on a board in millimetres) stays with the consumer,
//! because the schematic sheet and the PCB are different coordinate
//! spaces and legitimately lay a motif out differently. What each member
//! carries is a [`MemberBinding`]: the net that joins it to its anchor
//! and the two pins that meet on that net. That is the pin-level fact a
//! placer needs to put a decoupling capacitor next to the pad it
//! decouples, and it is what this module exists to produce.
//!
//! Passes run in a fixed order of specificity and share one `claimed`
//! set, so a part is claimed by the most specific motif that matches it:
//!
//! 1. LED indicator — LED plus its anode current-limit resistor.
//! 2. USB+ESD — USB connector plus ESD diodes on its pair pins.
//! 3. LDO block — regulator plus rail caps on `vin`/`vout`.
//! 4. Crystal — crystal plus its load capacitors.
//! 5. IC block — IC with `required_decoupling` and/or a reset pin, plus
//!    its decoupling caps, reset network, and pull resistors.
//! 6. I²C bus — part with `i2c_sda`/`i2c_scl` plus both pull-ups.
//! 7. Divider — rail-side resistor plus its mid-to-ground partner.
//! 8. RF matching — antenna plus its matching passives.
//! 9. Orphan rail caps — leftover rail-to-ground capacitors adopted by
//!    whichever cluster draws most heavily from their rail.
//!
//! Then declared groups bound membership (a group is a hard boundary),
//! and anything still unclaimed becomes a singleton.
