//! Pad-escape feasibility: can this package be fanned out at the fab floor?
//!
//! Borrowed from TraceMaker's `escape` command, whose framing is the useful
//! part: a fine-pitch package can be *unroutable at the chosen process* long
//! before a router runs, and the failure presents as mysterious necked-down
//! vias rather than as a clear "this cannot escape" answer. Running an
//! authoritative router for two minutes only to learn that the MCU's pins
//! cannot take a fab-floor via is time spent not knowing something we could
//! have computed in milliseconds.
//!
//! This is a *pre-routing* warning, deliberately conservative and deliberately
//! not a gate. A router can still complete such a board by staggering vias,
//! necking tracks, or using via-in-pad when the process allows. What it cannot
//! do is change the arithmetic, so the finding names the arithmetic: the pitch
//! the package offers, the via the floor requires, and the drill that would
//! actually fit.

// Board geometry spans at most ~1e9 nm, far inside f64's 2^52 exact-integer
// range, so every nm<->mm conversion here is exact rather than lossy.
