//! Why an external routing run did not produce a fabricable board.
//!
//! Every failure carries a stable machine-readable
//! [`RouterFailureReason`], the [`RouterStage`] it happened in, and a
//! remediation string. The reason exists because the three broad outcomes
//! a user has to tell apart — *the tool is not installed*, *the tool ran
//! but produced nothing*, and *the tool produced something the board's own
//! rules reject* — call for three completely different responses, and a
//! single "router error" string forces the user to guess which one they
//! are looking at.
