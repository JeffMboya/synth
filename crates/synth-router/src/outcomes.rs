//! A record of how a board actually routed, and what to try next time.
//!
//! Every routing attempt produces a run record that is thrown away once it
//! has been read. Kept instead, those records are the raw material for a
//! retry that starts smarter: the same board hash, routed before, knows which
//! nets were hardest and how many vias and how much copper each engine used.
//! This is the Dataset 6 hook the route tools already advertise, given a
//! concrete shape.
//!
//! Records are append-only JSON Lines in one file. Nothing here is read
//! during a run unless a caller asks for a suggestion, so the file can be
//! written continuously and pruned freely.
