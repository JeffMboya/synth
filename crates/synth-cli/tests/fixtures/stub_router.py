# Test double for an external PCB router.
#
# Installed as `python3` on PATH by the CLI integration tests, so the
# FreeRouting adapter invokes it exactly as it invokes the real helper: as the
# interpreter that will run tools/freeroute_autoroute.py. The shebang is an
# absolute path resolved by the test harness before this file is put on PATH,
# so it cannot resolve back to itself.
#
# Its job is to return a candidate that passes the same independent checks a
# real engine's output must pass, so the tests around it measure the gate
# rather than the stub. It does that in two steps:
#
#   1. It copies the un-routed baseline to the candidate, so the candidate is
#      a genuine router output rather than a file the tests wrote themselves.
#   2. It connects the pads of each net with a straight segment per pad pair.
#      Without this the fixture designs — which do have a net — would come
#      back as an unroutable board, and a test about an override or a release
#      manifest would fail for a reason unrelated to either.
#
# This is not a router and does not try to be. What it owes the pipeline is a
# board whose copper agrees with its own netlist, so that the independent
# topology and connectivity checks downstream have something real to confirm
# or reject. It reads only the text of the board it is given.
