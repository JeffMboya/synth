"""Score an exported schematic.

    python3 tools/schematic_quality.py board.kicad_sch [--json]

Needs kicad-cli. It plots the schematic to SVG and reads two things:

- wires from the `.kicad_sch` itself (every `(wire (pts ...))`, whatever its
  net class colour);
- text boxes from the plot: KiCad draws each string as a `stroked-text` group
  of glyph paths, so the box around the paths is where the text really is.

The numbers say how much of the page is collisions and how much is wasted:

  text_pairs_overlapping          pairs of texts whose boxes overlap
  texts_with_a_wire_through_them  texts with a wire running across them
  wire_crossings                  places two wires cross (a T is not one)
  wire_length_mm                  total wire
  region_coverage                 how much of the rectangle the group boxes span
                                  they cover (1.0 means they tile it, low means
                                  holes between and beside them)
  content_density                 share of 10 mm cells in the content box that
                                  hold a wire or text (low means wasted space;
                                  symbol outlines are not read, so it reads low)
  passive_to_pin_mean_mm          mean distance from a two-pin resistor or
  passive_to_pin_max_mm           capacitor (nearer pad) to the closest pin of
                                  another part on the same net, and the worst one
                                  (nets come from `kicad-cli sch export
                                  netlist`; a rail pin counts, so a part on a
                                  rail next to any pin of that rail reads near;
                                  0.0 when no passive could be measured)
  labels_repeating_pin_name       labels whose text is the name of the pin they
                                  stand beside
  items_outside_group_boxes       symbols and texts not wholly inside one group
                                  box (a symbol is the box round its pins and
                                  drawn outline; the page ruler and the title
                                  block are not content; 0 when there are no
                                  group boxes)
  title_gap_min_mm                smallest distance from a bold group caption
                                  down to the symbol, text or wire under it in
                                  its box (negative when they overlap; None when
                                  no caption has anything under it)
  flag_pairs_overlapping          pairs of net label flags whose boxes overlap
                                  (read from the `global_label` positions: a
                                  flag is FLAG_CHAR_MM per character plus
                                  FLAG_PAD_MM wide, FLAG_H_MM tall, and runs
                                  from its anchor away from its stub; boxes
                                  that overlap by less than FLAG_TOUCH_MM only
                                  touch, as flags on a 2.54 mm pin pitch do)
  flags_over_bodies               flags whose box overlaps the box of a placed
                                  symbol (its pin ends and drawn outline), by
                                  the same FLAG_TOUCH_MM; a flag runs out from
                                  its own pin's stub, so a part is only covered
                                  by the flag of another pin
  label_columns_misaligned        symbol sides whose labels do not line up: more
                                  than one distinct x on a left or right side,
                                  more than one distinct y on a top or bottom
                                  side (a label belongs to a pin when it sits on
                                  the pin's row or column, on the outward side,
                                  within LABEL_REACH_MM)

KiCad draws some strings twice in one place; each such string counts once.
Wires in Synth's schematics are axis aligned, so a wire is tested against a text
box by its bounding box.

They are a floor, not a grade: a schematic can score zero on all of them and
still be badly grouped. Lower is better for all but `content_density` and `region_coverage`.
